What exactly is 42?

What is 42? I write this post, my first post, hoping one day to truly be able to answer that question. I plan to revisit this question again for my final post, once I have reached 42’s highest level and completed my final internship.

Right now, I look at 42 as an opportunity. An opportunity to learn computer programming in an environment tailored toward my learning style, to develop an in demand skill which is shaping our future, and an opportunity to network with like minded individuals and industry giants. 42 is all of these things and so much more, but here are the facts.

42 is the baby of Xavier Niel. Niel is a french entrepreneur who is famous for founding Free, a french telecommunications company. Free shook up France by offering internet cheap and without a subscription. Niel found a way to put his success to good use by helping solve a french epidemic.

    “Niel’s solution is an opportunity for us all to rethink the education system”

France is a world leader in producing math, science and technology graduates. Yet the country is severely lacking in the production of software engineers. “There is a shortage of talent” exclaims Niel. His solution to this problem is an opportunity for us all to rethink the education system. With 100 million of his own money Niel opened a University in Paris. The goal: to produce 10,000 software engineers in the next decade.  Even more interesting, educate them all at no cost to the student.

Niel’s solution is 42. A coding University open 24/7 that gives out no degree, has no teachers, no classes, and best of all no tuition. Instead of the typical approach to education, classes, tests, grades, 42 challenges the students with problems. By solving increasingly difficult problems, the students learn by doing, by creating code, and by collaborating with each other.

42 openly encourages it’s students to solve these problems together. Since there are no teachers the school relies on a peer to peer learning system where we educate each other. There are even many large group projects, one of which is the students final masterpiece. In fact the layout is specifically designed to promote interaction.

The new school they are building in Fremont, California contains four large clusters of iMacs. Over 1000 brand new computers waiting for the hands of the next great software developers. The clusters are arranged so every one has at least 5 other students nearby they can immediately turn to and ask questions. In fact, the students even evaluate each other. Part of the experience at 42 involves reading and assessing the work of your peers. It is a truly revolutionary, approach to education and the school in Paris is proving it is working.

The school opened in 2013 and is finally starting to churn out graduates. The skills they have acquired in their 3 years have company’s waiting at the door to hire them. To begin they have learned computer programming skills that allow them to adapt to any language because they understand the basis of computer languages. The students are taught to be innovative. One of my favorite lines from 42’s website is “42 learners must be able to adapt, to think differently, in order to propose innovative solutions.” The students are taught to build operating systems from the ground up. They understand networking, system administration, cloud computing, data analysis, security and so much more. Many even have an understanding of entrepreneurship, the startup industry and how to manage a small business. 42 has a large tree of disciplines, all relevant to being a professional in the computer industry.

I think the best part of 42 is their willingness to teach these skills to anyone. One of the school’s principles is unbiased selection. They don’t care where you’re from, what your background is, or how well you did on the ACT. 42’s only requirements are that you’re between the age of 18 and 30 and that you pass two small assessment tests. If you succeed you will be invited to what is known as “La Piscine.” The pool, in french, is a rigorous 30 day training where applicants spend 15 hours a day for 30 days straight coding and solving problems with just each other for help. The school invites between 2,000 and 3,000 applicants for the piscine and only 1,024 of those are admitted to attend the university. It is a real sink or swim environment.

The one word I always use to describe 42 is Revolutionary; and just to recap I would like to list why:

    It is open to Anyone
    They provide the Best Resources
    In the Tech Capitol of the world
    With a one of a kind teaching method
    FOR FREE!!!
